            <h2>A few words about me...</h2>
            <p>Ladislav Uncovsky. This is my whole name, but everyone just calls me Laco. Not sure how to say it? No worries, it‚Äôs simply /la-tzo/.</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in the heart of Europe ‚Äì Slovakia, although now you can spot me biking or munching on stroopwafels in The Netherlands. As a second-year undergraduate student at THUAS, I am now gaining hands on experience as an intern. Working at the <b>Digital Society School</b> in Amsterdam made me realize how as an UX designer I can help solve global challenges. As an example, I can use my current project, where me together with my team are working on a project in the lights of UN Sustainable Development Goals. The project is about reducing waste at the University of Amsterdam, you can read more about it <span>here</span>.</p>
            <p>In the past year, I was also gaining experience as an intern in a design studio located in Bratislava called <b>Lighting Beetle</b>, where I was helping on projects for clients such as Orange, HB Reavis or Asseco.</p>

            <h2>Skills üñã</h2>
            <p>Throughout my studies of User Experience Design, I have had the chance to look
              into all parts of design thinking process and further utilize said parts in numerous
              group work.<br><br> For instance, when working on project ‚Äì Design for Emotion, I have
              successfully implemented all steps of design thinking process, while particularly focusing on
              prototyping.<br><br> As I am particularly intrigued by prototyping, beyond my university
              studies, I am further extending my skills by following a Adobe XD Challenges course.
              Hence, I believe I am quite experienced with low to high fidelity designing and
              prototyping, which is reflected in excellent project grades.<br><br> Both in school and my free
              time I am learning programming languages such as HTML/CSS or JavaScript. The basic knowledge of previously mentioned languages, allows me to
              have clearer perception of technologies, surrounding us.</p>
