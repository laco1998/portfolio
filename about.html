          <div class="introduction">
            <p>I am a second-year undergraduate user experience student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. I grew up in Bratislava, Slovakia, but for the past two years, I have been living in The Netherlands.<br><br> I am a very curious and open-minded person always striving for new challenges, therefore I moved to a foreign country. As I was a professional tennis player, sport shaped me as a person. Tennis gave me self-discipline, great time management skills and it taught me how to work individually.<br><br> Since I am a very goal-oriented person, with my designs I have a goal to make today's world less complicated and more enjoyable.</p>

            <h2>Skills üñã</h2>
            <p>Throughout my studies of User Experience Design, I have had the chance to look
              into all parts of design thinking process and further utilize said parts in numerous
              group work.<br><br> For instance, when working on project ‚Äì Design for Emotion, I have
              successfully implemented all steps of design thinking, while particularly focusing on
              prototyping.<br><br> As I am particularly intrigued by prototyping, beyond my university
              studies, I am further extending my skills by following a Adobe XD Challenges course.
              Hence, I believe I am quite experienced with low to high fidelity designing and
              prototyping, which is reflected in excellent project grades.<br><br> Both in school and my free
              time I am learning programming languages such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript and
              Processing. The basic knowledge of previously mentioned languages, allows me to
              have clearer perception of technologies, surrounding us.</p>
